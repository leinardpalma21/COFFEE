          <h2>History</h2> 
          <p class="p1">In the 15th century, wild coffee plants, 
            perhaps from Kefa (Kaffa), 
            Ethiopia, were transported 
            to southern Arabia and cultivated there. 
            One of the many legends surrounding the 
            discovery of coffee is that of Kaldi, an 
            Arab goatherd who was perplexed by his 
            flock's peculiar behavior. Supposedly, 
            about 850 C.E., Kaldi sampled the berries 
            of the evergreen bush on which the goats 
            were eating and, feeling exhilarated, 
            announced his discovery to the world.</p>

          <h2>Benefits</h2>     
          <p class="p2">Caffeine is a stimulant for the central 
            nervous system that may be found in coffee.
            Caffeine is famous for its ability to enhance 
            energy levels and battle exhaustion.</p>

          <h2>Effect</h2>    
          <p class="p3">Coffee drinking has been linked to a 
            variety of health advantages and dangers.
            In general, moderate consumption, equivalent 
            to three to four cups per day, is associated 
            with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, 
            type 2 diabetes, liver cancer, and Parkinson 
            disease. Moreover, research has associated 
            moderate coffee drinking with a longer 
            lifespan.</p>

     <section id="Question">
        <p id="what">?</p>
        <p id="explain">Coffee is a beverage prepared 
          from the roasted and ground seeds of 
          African-origin evergreen tropical coffee 
          trees. Coffee, along with water and tea, 
          is one of the three most popular beverages 
          in the world and one of the most profitable
          worldwide commodities. Caffeine, an alkaloid
          contained in coffee, has an energizing impact,
           which is largely responsible for the beverage's appeal.</p>
